# LVGL_Calculator<br>

This is a simple calculator for the Arduino environment runnung on a Waveshare ESP32S3 board. https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-4.3<br>
The graphics are created using the LVGL/LovyanGFX libraries.these should be imported into the Arduino environment ... see app for versions.<br>
It includes the config files for the EEZ Studio graphics designer system which I think is rather cool. https://www.envox.eu/studio/studio-introduction/<br>
the app consists of three components. The app, a simple expression evaluator which respects operator precedence, the src/ui dircetory which contain the<br>
code generated by the EEZ Studio designer and a file displaystuff.h which is the initialisation code for the display. This is from: https://gitlab.com/chris.willing.waveshare/lvgl-eezstudio-setup<br>
In addition, I have included my copy of lv_conf.h. This file should be placed in the Arduino libraries folder. I refer you to https://docs.lvgl.io/7.11/porting/project.html<br>
for some information about this rather critical file. It contains a large number of configuration elements. So, if you have a working version for your display, make a copy as I have in the app<br>
directory and copy it back to the Arduino libraries folder as needed. The most likley change you may need to make is to the selected fonts near line 364. This would be in the event that<br>
you have selected a font in EEZ Studio for whicj the setting in lv_conf.h is 0.<br>
It is worth reading the EEZ Studio section on events and how to manage them. This app is a reasonable example of this in the the action_button_clicked(...) function is called asynchronously<br>
from the LVGL idle loop in the loop() function. The function calls in this app show how to find the event source widget and its properties or directly reference a specific widget.<br>
I hope this app gives some insight into what is quite a daunting process of creating event driven graphics apps for the ESP32.<br>
